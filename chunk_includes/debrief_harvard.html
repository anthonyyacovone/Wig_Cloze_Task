<h2><u><center>DEBRIEFING:</center></u></h2>
  

<p><b><u>What is this study about?</u></b></p>

<ul>
  <li><p>This study examines how easily people predict different nouns given previous sentence context.</p></li>
  <li><p>People often have a difficult time predicting nouns at the beginning of a sentence.</p></li></ul>

<p><u>Imagine predicting the noun 'movies' given the sentences below:</u></p>
<p>1a. John has strong opinions about television shows but even more so about ___<u>movies<u>___<br>
1b. John likes ___movies___ </p>

<ul>
  <li><p>It is more difficult to accurately predict nouns with less context (1b).</p></li>
  <li><p>With more context, people can better anticipate upcoming nouns (1a).</p></li></ul>

<p><b><u>How is the study conducted?</u></b></p>

<p>In this task, you saw a story from beginning to end, sentence by sentence. We are looking to see how predictions differ across nouns in these sentences.</p>
  
<p><b>A few more questions: </b></p>

  <td colspan="2">Did you think the story was interesting and engaging?<br>

<tr>
  <td colspan="2">Overall, how predictable do you think the words were?<br>
   How well do you think you performed on this task?</td><br>
