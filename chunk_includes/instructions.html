<b>Instructions</b>
</p>
<p>
   Welcome! In this experiment, you will be reading a Moth story, which is a story that was originally spoken outloud by a person. You will be shown the entire story from beginning to end with some incomplete sentences. Your job is to fill in the blank(s) in each sentence to the best of your ability. This experiment requires your FULL ATTENTION. The experiment is reasonably brief, and should take no more than an hour (it is estimated to be about 30 minutes). During this time you must give it your complete attention.

During the introduction, we will ask you questions to ensure that you have understood the instructions. Please answer them correctly. If you do not follow the instructions, or if your responses indicate that you did not fully attend to this experiment, we reserve the right to withhold compensation.
