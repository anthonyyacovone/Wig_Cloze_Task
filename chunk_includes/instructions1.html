<p>
  In the experiment, you are going to be reading a story from beginning to end, sentence by sentence. The story will have blank(s) in different parts of the sentences, and every sentence has at least one blank. You will see the sentence preambles (or beginnings) and then you will be asked to fill in the blank for the next word for the sentence in a way that makes sense for the story. The text on the screen will disappear after every 10 blanks you are asked to fill in. However, the same story will continue. </p>
  
<p>
  There is no time limit on how long you have to respond. However, you may find yourself completing these sentences quite quickly!  
<br><br>
<p>
  A preamble could look something like, "The cat and the dog quickly ____" 
<br><br>
  <p>
  Below it (or next to it) you will see a blank space. Use this space to write the next word. 
<br><br>
  <p>
  A possible continuation for the example above could be, "went." Once finished, hit 'Enter' to submit response!
